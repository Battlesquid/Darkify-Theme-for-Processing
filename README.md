# Darkify Theme for Processing
A dark theme for the Processing Development Environment

### Installation
1. Close all Processing windows. **Changes in `theme.txt` and `preferences.txt` will not be saved if Processing is running.**
2. Navigate to the lib folder and replace the content `theme.txt` with the Darkify `theme.txt`.
3. Save a copy of the `toolbar` folder in another place (in case you want to revert back to the old icons), then replace it with the Darkify `toolbar` folder.
4. On your computer, navigate to `AppData/Roaming/Processing/`. You can also open Processing and navigate to the folder using `File->Preferences` and clicking on the preferences path at the bottom. Be sure to close Processing when you have the folder open, as changes will not be saved when Processing is running.
5. Replace the `preferences.txt` with the Darkify `preferences.txt`.
6. Enjoy!
